# Appointment-Scheduler

The entry point for the program is ScheduleManager::main.
ScheduleManager is fully implemented, and ServerProxy is mostly implemented. There are a couple stubs, and the method to get the next appointment request currently doesn't work due to a deserialization error.

This was a fun project to build! Thanks!
